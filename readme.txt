   This is the sandorf cipher,

         Very low running time complexity, you can make it more complex to decipher... (hint:you just have to vary the padding.)

         Well, its an elementary cipher- actually a nice game for kids to play. So dont use it for top secret stuff! :)

           Nice to note that- how you put the holes on the square board matters- when you rotate, you should span the whole board! 

         Something like the linear Algebra basis? ;P
